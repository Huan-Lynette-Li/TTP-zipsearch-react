######Zip Code Search React######

The app allows users to search by Zip Code and retrieve information about Cities within that Zip Code.


To implement this app, I Used a Zip Code API that was provided.

A simple Zip Code search app. 


Users will need to enter a valid zip code in the input field to retrieve the information they are looking for.
